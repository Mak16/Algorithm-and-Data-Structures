problem : find an index of peak element in the array.
#there can be multiple peak
# 0<k<n  if arr[k] >= arr[k-1] and arr[k] >= arr[k+1]  then peak at k
# if k==0 and arr[k] > arr[k+1] then peak at k
# if k==n-1 and arr[k] > arr[k-1] then peak at k

Recurrence relation :
t(n) = t(n/2)+c

time complexity = O(log n)

space complexity = O(n) [#size of array]

#to find all the peak :time complexity = O(n)
